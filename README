dsblocks - dwm status blocks
============================
dsblocks is simple status blocks for dwm with signaling support.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dsblocks youu need Xlib, alsa, and math header files

Features
-------
- Date
- Battery percentage
- Laptop brightness percentage
- Microphone percentage and status (ALSA)
- Speaker percentage and status (ALSA)

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dsblocks is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default)

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dsblocks
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Signaling Change
----------------
signaler.c can be used to test sending signal like this
    ./signaler <block_signal> <block_button> <pid>


Notes
-----
In my hardware ALSA volume detection is delayed so the workaround
is retriggering dsblocks change after started it in .xinitrc

    dsblocks &
    (sleep 1; pkill -RTMIN+4 dsblocks && pkill -RTMIN+5 dsblocks) &
